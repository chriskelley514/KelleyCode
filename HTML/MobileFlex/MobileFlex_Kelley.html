            <p>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen.</p>

            <p>The curse of mortality is that we get one life, one point of view, at a single point in time at most. If we are lucky, we know a few languages to access the world and understand it. But writing cheats that.</p>
